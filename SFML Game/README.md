# WARNING: SFML REQUIRED

A complete game wherein you, the player, jump a red rectangle over moving white boxes which appear at random intervals. 
The player has three lives, and the enemies (boxes) always appear at intervals that are far enough apart that the player 
may always successfully jump over the enemies.

At the end of the game, a score is displayed, and the player may choose to restart the game.
