# Warning: SFML Required for Visualization

This is an engine to predict the spread of a virus in a network of humans.
It uses several variables to determine spread: whether a person socially 
distances and wears a mask or not, the number of people in each other
person's network, the probability of spread with human contact (given
mask or no), and how many total people there are.

SFML is used to generate graphics for the spread for visualization.
